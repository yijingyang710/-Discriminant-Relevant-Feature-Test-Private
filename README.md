# On Supervised Feature Selection from High Dimensional Feature Spaces
Created by Yijing Yang, Wei Wang, Hongyu Fu and C.-C. Jay Kuo from University of Southern California.

### Introduction
This is an official implementation of our work [DFT/RFT feature selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11924.pdf). A faster implementation of the DFT/RFT loss can be found in the [cpp version](https://github.com/jjiachilin/slm-loss).

### Contents
* `feat_utils.py`: The function `feature_selection` is the main function for DFT-based feature selection.
